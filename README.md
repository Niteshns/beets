## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

We used the tool Coverage.py.
Steps we took to do the test:
1. Enter the repository path in vscode.
2. Inside the repository, we went to path "/test".
3. We then executed the coverage tool on the inbuild unit tester with the command: "coverage run testall.py".
4. After the testing, we ran the command: "coverage report" to get the coverage test results.
